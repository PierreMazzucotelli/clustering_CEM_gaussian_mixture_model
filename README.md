# Data Clustering with a Gaussian Mixture Model

This repository contains the implementation of a data clustering project using the Classification Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm to segment data into meaningful clusters. Leveraged probabilistic modeling and Python programming to develop, evaluate, and visualize the modelâ€™s performance.

## Project Overview

- Implemented the CEM algorithm to partition data into meaningful clusters.
- Modeled data probabilistically using Gaussian mixtures.
- Evaluated and visualized clustering performance.

## Files

- `Cherkaoui_Mazzucotelli_19_23.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries (if not already installed).
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells.
